*Repository for a Fluid Consumption Classifier and Estimator*

## Data
- Audio Data will be collect by the 3 collaborators using a [AV-JEFE TR-15 Throat Transdermal Microphone for Speech Difficulties](https://www.superaudioworld.com/product-page/av-jefe-tr-15-throat-transdermal-microphone-for-speech-difficulties) and stored as digital audio files in the lossless Waveform Audio File format (.wav) format

## Files
1. FC_Classifier.py: 
The classifier classifies audio signals into drinking and non-drinking events
2. FC_Estimator.py: 
The estimator estimates the volume of fluid consumed during drinking events
